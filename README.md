# object_detection_and_tracking
In this project I have implemented a Flask application that can capture and display a live webcam feed in a web browser. I have integrated object detection into the application using YOLOv5. The application is capable of identifying objects in the live webcam feed. I have implemented object tracking into the application using DeepSORT.
